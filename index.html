            <p>
                Dubai has a rich, Arabic cultural heritage. While it is now more known for its intriguing mix of deserts, 
                beaches and luxurious manmade feats, the culture of the Emirati people still have a major role to play. 
                Dubai is an absolute monarchy. The Al Maktoum family have reigned there since 1833—the current ruler being 
                His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bi Rashid Al Maktoum. In addition to being the Crown Prince of Dubai, 
                His Highness Sheikh Hamdan is also the Chairman of Dubai’s Executive Council and, like his predecessors, 
                has wisely and progressively led Dubai into prosperity. Although tradition and culture underpin life in Dubai, 
                the UAE state is a warmly hospitable destination. Emirati people tend to preserve Islamic heritage, 
                with the majority being Muslim. Despite this, the people of Dubai are extremely tolerant of their multicultural citizens 
                and guests—all religious beliefs are welcome. Over 200 nationalities call Dubai home, including Emiratis, 
                ndians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Sri Lankans and Americans (just to name a few!). 
                Each new group has brought with them their own style, strengths and flavours. 
                There are currently over 6000 restaurants and cafés in the bustling city, offering every cuisine imaginable.
